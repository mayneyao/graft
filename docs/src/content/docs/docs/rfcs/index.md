This section contains design documents outlining significant changes, enhancements, and decisions related to the project.

Each RFC is a proposal that introduces a new feature, refactors a major component, or alters how the system behaves. The goal is to provide a clear, written record of the motivation, rationale, and implications behind technical decisions.

## Why RFCs?

RFCs help us:
- Collaborate on complex ideas before implementation.
- Provide a historical record of design decisions.
- Encourage thoughtful discussion and structured design thinking.

## Contributing

To propose a change:
1. Run `just run rfc new` to create a new RFC.
2. Fill out all relevant sections.
3. Open a pull request.
4. Collaborate and iterate based on feedback.

We welcome thoughtful proposals and discussion. You don’t need to get everything right—clarity and intent matter most.

This process is inspired by the [Rust RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) and similar systems used by many open source communities.
