## Usage

To use Graft with Node.js's built-in SQLite module, **Node.js version 23.10.0 or later is required**, as this is the first version that supports URI-formatted database connections needed by Graft.

```javascript
import * as sqliteGraft from "sqlite-graft";
// Also should work with other javascript SQLite libraries:
import { DatabaseSync } from "node:sqlite";

// load the graft extension
let db = new DatabaseSync(":memory:", { allowExtension: true });
sqliteGraft.load(db);

// open a Graft volume as a database and run graft_status
db = new DatabaseSync("file:random?vfs=graft");
let result = db.prepare("PRAGMA graft_status");
console.log(result.all());
```

You can also use Graft with `better-sqlite3` and older versions of Node by setting the environment variable `GRAFT_MAKE_DEFAULT=true`. This will cause Graft to register itself as the _default_ VFS for all new SQLite connections, so no URI path required.
