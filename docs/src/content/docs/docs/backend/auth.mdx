Currently the Graft backend is authenticated using [PASETO]. A simple token based authentication system.

[PASETO]: https://paseto.io/

<Aside type="caution">
  In this guide, keys are shown with portions masked. This is to _ensure_ that
  you do not use the keys or tokens in this document. Authentication secrets
  should be generated in a secure environment and stored correctly.
</Aside>

To configure PASETO, you first need to generate a 32-byte hex-encoded secret key:

```bash
$ just run tool secret-key
86d94c08c767...d74c5a8282f81367886255
```

This key must be specified in the PageStore and MetaStore config:

```toml
[auth]
key = "86d94c08c767...d74c5a8282f81367886255"
```

You can also specify the key with the environment variables `PAGESTORE_AUTH__KEY` and `METASTORE_AUTH__KEY`.

Once configured, all requests must include a PASETO token generated using the same key. You can generate a token for a particular subject like so:

```console
$ SK=86d94c08c767...d74c5a8282f81367886255
$ just run tool token --sk $SK subject-name
v4.local.PxdyJ4TwdDIWRUp0C...kgr8Ha11PHD_j9OAUeupqJ_bWa0UJ56nVMk7U
```

Subjects are just metadata attached to the token to differentiate between who is accessing Graft. Graft will eventually associate permissions with subjects in order to enable fine-grained Authorization.

The first token you generate should be for the PageStore to communicate with the MetaStore. You can use any subject, but I like to use `graft-pagestore`. The token can be provided to the PageStore via the config (`token = "..."`) or environment variable: `PAGESTORE_TOKEN=...`.

Once PASETO authentication is configured, all Graft clients must use a valid token. See the [Graft SQLite config](/docs/sqlite/config) for more information on configuring the token to use with the Graft SQLite extension.
