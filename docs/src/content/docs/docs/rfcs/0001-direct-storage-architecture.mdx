Build a new Graft client library (called `graft-kernel`) which directly interfaces with object storage, eliminating the need for the MetaStore and PageStore, and setting Graft up as a viable replacement to systems like Litestream. Graft should focus on providing best-in-class PITR, branching, and sparse replication for page-based workloads.

## Motivation

An overview of why we should consider making this major change to Graft's architecture.

### Existing state of Graft

Currently Graft requires a MetaStore and PageStore to support replication to and from object storage. This architecture has the following advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages**
- The MetaStore can efficiently rollup commits to fast forward clients, increasing performance and enabling instant read replicas
- The PageStore acts as a smart cache, allowing clients to pull only the pages they need at the edge.
- The PageStore is able to collocate writes to multiple Volumes in the same Segment which can reduce the cost and overhead of small transactions.

**Disadvantages**
- There is little isolation between data in different Volumes. Graft will need to roll out a comprehensive encryption + authorization layer to work for production workloads. This is a huge cost in terms of testing and engineering.
- Users must run two services to take full advantage of Graft, this makes Graft much harder to use.

### [Datasette]

In a discussion with [Simon Willison] and [Alex Garcia], we talked about some of their dream features for SQLite + Graft:

**Rollback database to earlier version**
The ability to cheaply rollback a database would make risky features like giving an LLM read/write access to your database much safer. Additionally, the ability to branch a database at a particular version may enable risk-free experimentation and testing.

**Read-only replication**
Cheap and fast read-only replication to horizontally scale a heavy query workload over multiple machines, or simply to expose data to less-trusted users.

**Composability with IAM permissions**
Currently, Datasette uses IAM keys limited to a single S3 prefix to restrict Litestream's access to a single tenant's data. This ensures that a bug in Litestream can affect at most a single tenant.

This feature implies that data does not cross "tenant" boundaries (or in this case, the configured S3 prefix).

### Object storage scalability

In a discussion with a potential user, they expressed reservations due to the layer of indirection between the Graft client and object storage. Their main argument is that S3 is already proven to handle extremely high scale. They would be more comfortable using Graft if clients connected directly to object storage to pull changes. In some cases, this may also reduce costs due to free bandwidth between compute and S3.

### New user experience

Graft should work out of the box without needing additional services to run. By supporting direct access to object storage, it will be easier to get started and embed Graft in an application.

## Guide-level Explanation

A high level explanation of how this feature works, and would change the behavior of existing Graft clients such as `graft-sqlite` and `graft-fuse`.

### `graft-kernel`

`graft-kernel` implements the Graft Kernel which supersedes the functionality of the `graft-client` and `graft-server` crates. The Kernel provides access to a remote Volume Catalog, local storage, and client functionality to downstream crates like `graft-sqlite` and `graft-fuse`.

**Client functionality**
Clients such as `graft-sqlite` and `graft-fuse` will use the `graft-kernel` to operate on Volumes. The Kernel is designed to be embedded in the application, performing I/O in a small set of background threads. The Kernel will be implemented as an async core wrapped with an async and sync API.

### `graft-proxy`

The Graft Proxy is a stateless edge service and caching layer which makes it easier for Graft to replicate to & from devices. Initially it will simply act as a pass-through proxy to object storage with its own authentication and authorization layer.

Graft Proxy exposes a simple API to consumers, enabling two key performance features:
1. Graft Proxy caches reads from object storage.
2. Replica fast-forwarding: collapse a pull graft request and only return the latest segments.

Eventually Graft Proxy will enhance Graft with these features:
- volume subscriptions -> eliminate the need to poll for changes
- granular authorization
- direct byte range puts and gets against Volumes, enabling "dumb clients".

## Reference-level Explanation

Detailed technical breakdown. Cover APIs, algorithms, data structures, formats, edge cases, and performance implications.

### Glossary

- **`Volume Handle`**: A reference to a local-remote Volume pair. Also responsible for tracking synchronization between a local and remote Volume. Documented more in the [Volume Handle](#volume-handle) section.
- **`vid`**: A 16 byte Volume ID using [`GID`] encoding.
- **`sid`**: A 16 byte Segment ID using [`GID`] encoding.
- **`Snapshot`**: A frozen point-in-time view of a Volume.
- **`lsn`**: Documented in the [Volume log](#volume-log) section.
- **`pageidx`**: A 4 byte page index, representing the index of a page within a Volume. Valid range: `[1, 2^32)`.
- **`Splinter`**: A compressed bitset, used to keep track of which `pageidxs` appear in a Segment.
- **`Segment`**: A sequence of pages, sorted by `pageidx`.
- **`VolumeRef`**: A `(vid, lsn)` tuple, representing a fixed point in a Volumes history.
- **`CommitHash`**: Documented in the [Commit hash](#commit-hash) section.

### Volume log

A volume’s durable state consists of a **Checkpoint** and a **Log**.

- **Checkpoint** — a point-in-time mapping from each non-empty `pageidx` to the version (by LSN) that was current when the checkpoint was taken.
- **Log** — an append-only sequence of log records. Each record contains the set of pages modified since the previous LSN.

#### Log Sequence Numbers (LSNs)

| Property       | Definition                                                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain**     | Unsigned 64-bit integer in the range `[1, 2^64)`. Zero is invalid. |
| **Ordering**   | Strictly increasing, gap-free, and scoped per volume.              |
| **Encoding**   | Canonical representation is `CBE64`: one’s-complement, big-endian. |

Because `0` is never a valid LSN, it's available as a sentinel value.

#### `CBE64` Encoding

- **Binary form** — 8-byte array. Bytewise comparison yields descending numeric order. Used for space-efficient storage, such as in embedded key-value stores like [Fjall].
- **Hex form** — 16-character, zero-padded, uppercase hexadecimal string. Lexicographically sorts in the same order as the binary form. Used where human readability is preferred, such as object store keys.

The CBE64 encoding allows both local key-value stores and object stores to perform forward iteration over keys to process log records in descending LSN order, without additional index structures.

### Commit hash

To verify data integrity, we attach a hash to each `Commit`. To compute the hash, we use the following method:

First, a [blake3] hash is computed for each Segment:

```python
def segment_hash(pages):
  hasher = blake3::new()
  hasher.write(HashHeader::Segment(PAGE_SIZE));
  # pages must be in order by pageidx
  for page in pages:
    hasher.write(page)
  return hasher.hash()
```

Then a Commit hash is produced by combining the Segment hashes together:

```python
def commit_hash(snapshot, segment_hashes):
  hasher = blake3::new()
  hasher.write(HashHeader::Commit(snapshot));
  # segment_hashes must be in order by pageidx
  for hash in segment_hashes:
    hasher.write(hash)
  return hasher.hash()
```

This two phase approach allows the Segment hashes to be produced in parallel, before combining them into a Commit hash.

Note that the Commit's snapshot is passed in. This ensures the Hash's uniqueness incorporates the Volume ID, LSN, and page count.

### Volume Handle

Rather than forcing users to reference Volumes by ID, Graft exposes Volume Handles. Volume Handles are pointers to a local and remote Volume. Volume Handles only exist on a single client, and are not shared between clients or pushed to a remote.

Each Volume Handle has a name given to it at creation time. The name must match the regex `^[_a-z][-_a-z0-9]{0,127}$` and be unique on the client.

A Volume Handle always has a local-only Volume associated with it. This Volume is used for all local reads and writes.

A Volume Handle may be linked to a remote Volume. In this case, the local and remote Volumes will be kept in sync by the sync subsystem.

### Remote storage

#### Object storage keyspace

Graft will store all of a Volume's data in Object Storage using the following keyspace layout:

```
{prefix} /
  {vid} /
    control: Control
    forks /
      {fork-vid}: Fork
    checkpoints: CheckpointSet
    log /
      {lsn}: Commit
    segments /
      {sid}: Segment
```

This flexible layout allows users to isolate tenants from one another by simply providing a unique `{prefix}`. This can be helpful when using AWS IAM to scope access keys to particular S3 prefixes for example.

#### Object storage schemas

All of the files aside from Segments are encoded using Protobuf. Serialized Protobuf is wrapped with a zerocopy `ProtobufEnvelope`:

```rust
struct ProtobufEnvelope {
    magic: [u8; 4],
    version: u8,
    _padding: [u8; 3],
    message: [u8]
}
```

Segments are simply encoded as a set of pages stored back-to-back, ordered by `pageidx` ascending. As they are accessed via Byte-Range requests, pages must start at offset 0. Any metadata about a Segment is contained in the Commit log.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package graft.remote.v1;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

// A Volume has a top level control file stored at
// `{prefix}/volumes/{vid}/control`
// Control files are immutable.
message Control {
  // The Volume ID stored as a 16 byte GID.
  bytes vid = 1;

  // The parent reference if this Volume is a fork.
  optional VolumeRef parent = 2;

  // The creation timestamp of this Volume.
  google.protobuf.Timestamp created_at = 3;
}

// When a Volume is forked, a ref is first written to the parent Volume:
// `{prefix}/volumes/{parent-vid}/forks/{fork-vid}`
// Forks are immutable.
message Fork {
  // The VID of the fork.
  bytes fork_vid = 1;

  // The fork point. Must match the parent field in the Fork's Control file.
  VolumeRef parent = 2;
}

// A reference to a Volume at a particular LSN.
message VolumeRef {
  // The Volume ID stored as a 16 byte GID.
  bytes vid = 1;

  // The referenced LSN.
  uint64 lsn = 2;
}

// A snapshot of a Volume.
message Snapshot {
  // The Volume ID stored as a 16 byte GID.
  bytes vid = 1;

  // The LSN of the Volume at this Snapshot.
  uint64 lsn = 2;

  // The Volume's page count at this Snapshot.
  uint32 page_count = 3;
}

// A Volume's CheckpointSet is stored at `{prefix}/volumes/{vid}/checkpoints`.
// CheckpointSets are updated by the checkpointer via compare-and-swap.
message CheckpointSet {
  // The Volume ID stored as a 16 byte GID.
  bytes vid = 1;

  // The list of checkpoint LSNs.
  repeated uint64 lsns = 2;
}

// Commits are stored at `{prefix}/volumes/{vid}/log/{lsn}`.
// There are some valid cases for a commit to not include any SegmentRefs:
//  - The commit marks a new Checkpoint. The corresponding Checkpoint (referenced by the `checkpoint_lsn` field) will contain the SegmentRefs associated to the checkpoint.
//  - The Volume has been truncated or extended causing the `page_count` to change, but no new pages to be written.
// Commits are immutable.
message Commit {
  // The Volume Snapshot at this Commit.
  Snapshot snapshot = 1;

  // A 256 bit CommitHash of this Commit.
  bytes hash = 2;

  // The list of SegmentRefs representing this Commit.
  repeated SegmentRef segments = 3;
}

message SegmentRef {
  // The 16 byte Segment ID.
  bytes sid = 1;

  // The set of pageidxs stored in this Segment.
  // Serialized using Splinter encoding.
  bytes splinter = 2;
}
```

### Local storage

This section documents how clients store data.

#### Local keyspace
Local storage uses [Fjall], a partitioned k/v store. In the following keyspace, the top level keys are independent partitions. The remainder of the keys and the values are encoded using types in the following section.

```
handles / {name} -> VolumeHandle

volumes / {vid} /
  // The parent reference if this Volume is a fork.
  parent -> VolumeRef

  // the latest LocalCheckpointSet for this Volume
  checkpoints -> LocalCheckpointSet

log / {vid} / {lsn} -> Snapshot

segments / {vid} / {lsn} / {min_pageidx, max_pageidx} / {sid} -> Splinter

pages / {sid} / {pageidx} -> Page
```

#### Local schemas

Keys which are stored in the local keyspace are encoded using `zerocopy` types. `lsn` values are stored using `CBE64`, which ensures they naturally sort in descending order. This allows us to use a forward iterator to quickly find the most recent LSN, which is much more efficient in most k/v stores (including [Fjall]).

The `handles` partition is unique in that it is keyed directly by the `VolumeHandle`'s name rather than one of the following zerocopy types.

```rust
enum VolumeProperty {
    Parent = 1,
    Checkpoints = 2,
}

struct VolumeKey {
    vid: VolumeId,
    property: VolumeProperty,
}

struct LogKey {
    vid: VolumeId,
    lsn: CBE64,
}

struct SegmentKey {
    commit: LogKey,
    min_pageidx: PageIdx,
    max_pageidx: PageIdx,
    sid: SegmentId,
}

struct PageKey {
    sid: SegmentId,
    pageidx: PageIdx,
}
```

Values stored locally are encoded using protobuf, using a combination of the remote storage schema and the following additional message types. No envelope is needed for local values as the upgrade process can migrate local data.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package graft.local.v1;
import "graft/remote/v1/index.proto";

message LocalCheckpointSet {
  // The etag from the last time we pulled the CheckpointSet, used to only pull
  // changed CheckpointSets
  bytes etag = 1;

  // The list of checkpoint LSNs.
  repeated uint64 lsns = 2;
}

message VolumeHandle {
  // The name of the Volume Handle
  string name = 1;

  // References to the local and remote Volumes, along with LSNs representing their latest successful synchronization.
  graft.remote.v1.VolumeRef local = 2;
  optional graft.remote.v1.VolumeRef remote = 3;

  // Presence of the pending_commit field means that the Push operation is in the process of committing to the remote. If no such Push job is currently running (i.e. it was interrupted), this field must be used to resume or abort the commit process.
  optional PendingCommit pending_commit = 4;
}

message PendingCommit {
  // The resulting remote LSN that the push job is attempting to create
  uint64 remote_lsn = 1;

  // The associated 256 bit commit hash. This is used to determine whether or not the commit has landed in the remote, in the case that we are interrupted while attempting to push.
  bytes commit_hash = 2;
}
```

### Algorithms

**checkpointing**

need to plan this out. one big thing is how to handle Forks. I think that checkpointing will need to prioritize checkpointing forks before parents in order to quickly eliminate cascading reads.

pull is also a bit odd. to pull volume x, we need to also pull x's parents recursively until we encounter the nearest checkpoint. and if/when any of x's parents are checkpointed in the future, we should be aware of that so GC can clear unused volumes.

by making local storage work around named refs this also doubles as keeping track of which volumes the user actually cares about.

a named ref can also handle sync state / staging volume refs, centralizing all of the sync logic accordingly.

need to think about the best way to handle parent/checkpoint metadata with named refs. the parent refs should be immutable so we could store them in volume specific metadata. checkpoints are mutable, however since they result in updating the segments partition, the only real need for them are:
- to handle empty pages during reads
- to run checkpointing locally (maybe?)
- gc needs to know about checkpoints for reachability

we could just store the latest checkpoint lsn in the snapshot? we need it during every read anyways.

does this make gc more tricky? it will need to monitor all open snapshots to determine what's visible. it probably determines vis something like:
- collect a list of volumerefs from every open snapshot and localref
- collect a list of checkpoints by scanning every volume's log
  - we can optimize this by storing checkpoints somewhere - they are immutable, and we only have to store the checkpoint lsns
- resolve each volumerefs visibility into a visibility set which contains a visible lsn range for every visible volume
  - when calculating a volumeref's visibility, look for checkpoints which exist between the oldest and newest visible lsn - these checkpoints can be used in place of the oldest lsn
- once the visibility set has been calculated, gc can iterate through all volumes and delete lsn ranges that are inaccessible

**issue: multi-parent fork + checkpoint**
currently it seems like tracking a multi-level forked volume is tricky due to checkpointing. in theory we would need to monitor all of the parent volumes for new checkpoints in order to minimize the chance that we get impacted by remote checkpointer gc. however, we otherwise don't want to subscribe to the entire commit log of every parent volume as we need relatively little information.

ideas to make this cheaper:
- make the remote checkpoint prefix an actual log, such that clients can subscribe to checkpoint logs rather than commit logs for upstream volumes
  - this also allows a client to subscribe to a volume's checkpoint rather than commit log, which effectively just reduces the rate of update
- put checkpoints in prefix level multi-volume log
  - this may become very costly for large amounts of volumes
  - although this log could just store volume refs, pointing at the corresponding checkpoint files
- somehow store parent checkpoint information directly in the fork's log?
  - this means each commit may be a pointer into another volume's log
  - possibly multiple parents away
  - this feels dirty. lets say you start with a fork X on a parent Y
    - checkpoint triggers at X:1, and writes a commit to X with X:1 being the checkpoint
    - however, the rest of the commits in X's log all still reference Y, even though Y is no longer needed to resolve any read on X
    - this is particularly bad for multi-parent forks, where a downstream fork now *must* monitor all of the commits for all upstream parents to track checkpointing

**decision: real checkpoint log per volume**
1. enables less granular volume subscriptions which may be useful for certain kinds of workloads
2. clients can monitor upstream volume checkpoints without monitoring their commit logs
3. however, this composes with those upstream volumes being opened - as we just need to pull the relevant portions of the commit logs
4. it may make sense for a volume reader to resolve the checkpoint + parent stack when opening a snapshot. this will reduce the page read cost, and make gc a bit easier. and because we write checkpoints directly to the segment log, those readers will still be able to implictily take advantage of newer checkpoints, although empty pages may still fall through.

**issue: empty pages**
- pages which are never written to, can simply be omitted
- however, once a page has been written to, we need to also track when it's cleared
- currently this requires writing an empty page to a segment
  - except in the case of truncation, in which case the smaller page count implicitly clears all orphaned pages
  - however, in this case, truncation + expansion will result in those pages becoming visible again... which may not be what the user wants
- if segments are compressed, this isn't too bad
- but as of right now, segments are not compressed, and thus this results in unhappy writes

why are pages empty:
1. page is implicitly empty due to being outside of the Volume's page_count
2. the volume was extended by changing the page count, and page does not exist in any visible segment
3. an empty page was explicitly written

in theory, filesystems optimize for the first two cases, and treat the third case like any other page write.

graft is already somewhat optimized for the first two cases, and can probably ignore the third case.

however we do need to decide how to handle truncate + extend.
right now, graft will expose previous page contents after truncate + extend up to the new page count.
one way to fix this is by having the reader look at each snapshot's page size as it iterates through the commit log. if it sees any page count smaller than the requested pageidx as it scans backward, it can immediately terminate the read with an empty page
however this does impact our read perf, as we would need to scan both the segment and snapshot log rather than just the segment log.
  -> we could merge the logs like we originally did, allowing a single scan to read the snapshots

alternatively we can just make this explicit. truncate + extend results in visibility. thus to explicitly erase a page you would need to either write an empty page, or checkpoint after the truncate.

to match the expected semantics of filesystems, truncate + extend should result in empty pages... but for now we can make this a graft special. eventually we could consider adding a tombstone bitmap to commits... that would also allow arbitrary hole punching and make empty pages explicit. but at the cost of a lot more metadata in the log.

#### Locks

##### **`commit_lock`**
This lock is held while writing to the `log` and `segments` partitions. This happens during the following operations:

- **Volume commit**: When committing to a Volume, we hold the `commit_lock` to verify the latest snapshot and write out a new snapshot.
- **Checkpoint**: To finish applying a checkpoint, we rewrite the snapshot and segments at the checkpoint LSN. The lock is only held to compare and swap the snapshot and update the segments.
- **GC**: The GC optimistically determines what it can safely to without holding the lock. Once it has a plan of action, GC will incrementally hold this lock while erasing in-accessible snapshots and segments.

##### **`metadata_lock(vid)`**
This is a sharded lock which must be held when modifying the `volumes` partition for a particular Volume. It only prevents concurrent metadata operations on the same Volume. Relevant operations include:

- **Push volume**: When pushing a Volume to the server.




TODO:
  - feels like we need a lock to ensure that meta-level ops are non-concurrent with respect to a single volume
  - and another lock for ensuring that commits to a single volume are serializable
  - and perhaps another lock for cross-volume ops?
    - ideally gc can be incremental and take advantage of the monotonicity of the log and segments partitions

The `log` and `segments` partitions are monotonic.

#### Volume Reader

Reading from a Volume requires creating a `VolumeReader` from a `VolumeHandle` at either the latest or a specific snapshot.

```python
def visibility_path(snapshot):
  cursor = VolumeRef { vid: snapshot.vid, lsn: snapshot.lsn }
  path = []
  while cursor:
    if checkpoints = read(f"volumes/{cursor.vid}/checkpoints"):
      if checkpoint = checkpoints.for(snapshot.lsn):
        # found checkpoint, we can terminate the path here
        path.push((cursor, (cursor.lsn)..=(checkpoint.lsn)))
        return path

    # no checkpoint, so scan to the beginning
    path.push((cursor, (cursor.lsn)..=1))
    # and iterate to the parent
    cursor = read(f"volumes/{cursor.vid}/parent")

  return path

class VolumeHandle:
  # inherits properties from graft.local.v1.VolumeHandle:
  # name, local, remote, pending_commit

  def reader():
    snapshot = last(f"log/{self.local.vid}")
    return VolumeReader::new(snapshot)

  def reader_at(snapshot):
    assert_eq(snapshot.vid, self.local.vid)
    return VolumeReader::new(snapshot)

class VolumeReader:
  def new(snapshot):
    self.snapshot = snapshot
    self.path = visibility_path(snapshot)

def read_page(snapshot, pageidx):
  (vid, lsn, page_count) = snapshot
  if not page_count.contains(pageidx):
    return None
  for key, splinter in iter_segments(vid, lsn):
    page_range = (min_pageidx, max_pageidx) = key.bounds()
    if not page_range.contains(pageidx):
      continue
    page = read(f"pages/{key.sid}/{pageidx}")
    if page:
      return page
    return remote_read_page(vid, key.sid, splinter, pageidx)

def iter_segments(vid, lsn):
  scans = []
  cursor = vid
  while cursor:
    checkpoint = read(f"volumes/{cursor}/checkpoint")
    start = lsn if cursor == vid else UINT64_MAX
    end = checkpoint.lsn if checkpoint else 0
    scans.push((cursor, start..=end))
    cursor = None if checkpoint else read(f"volumes/{cursor}/parent")

  result = []
  for scan in scans:
    top = f"segments/{scan.0}/{scan.1.start}"
    bottom = f"segments/{scan.0}/{scan.1.end}"
    result = chain(result, iter(top..=bottom))
  return result

def remote_read_page(vid, sid, splinter, pageidx):
  segment_size = splinter.cardinality()
  chunk = calculate_chunk_request(sid, splinter, pageidx)
  # fetch the chunk from object storage, loading the pages into `pages/{sid}/{pageidx}`
  return read(f"pages/{sid}/{pageidx}")

def calculate_chunk_request(segment, pageidx):
  # determine which portion of the segment to retrieve by inspecting which portions we've already cached and configuration
  # in general we want to read more than 1 page at a time from s3
  pass
```

#### Volume Writer

Writing to a Volume requires the VID of the parent Volume as well as a read snapshot. The read snapshot should be the latest logical snapshot of the Volume, which means it may reference a Writer volume.

```python
class VolumeWriter:
  def new(vid, snapshot):
    self.vid = vid
    self.snapshot = snapshot
    self.page_count = snapshot.page_count
    self.sid = SegmentId::random()
    self.splinter = Splinter::new()

  def read(pageidx):
    if self.splinter.contains(pageidx):
      return read(f"pages/{self.sid}/{pageidx}")
    else:
      read_page(self.snapshot, pageidx)

  def write(pageidx, page):
    self.splinter.insert(pageidx)
    self.page_count = max(self.page_count, pageidx.pages())
    write(f"pages/{self.sid}/{pageidx}", page)

  def truncate(page_count):
    self.page_count = page_count
    delete_range(f"pages/{self.sid}/{page_count}"..)

  # also triggered on drop
  def rollback():
    delete_prefix(f"pages/{sid}")

  def commit():
    storage.lock()

    # verify we are the latest snapshot
    # due to how snapshot works, this will also fail if the writer Volume has changed
    snapshot = snapshot(self.vid)
    if self.snapshot != snapshot:
      raise "concurrent write"

    tx = begin()

    # determine the writer vid and lsn
    writer_vid = get_or_create_writer(tx, self.vid)
    writer_lsn = snapshot.lsn.next() if snapshot.vid == writer_vid else LSN::FIRST

    tx.write(f"log/{writer_vid}/{writer_lsn}", Snapshot {
      vid = writer_vid,
      lsn = writer_lsn,
      page_count = self.page_count
    })

    (min, max) = self.splinter.bounds()
    tx.write(
      f"log/{writer_vid}/{writer_lsn}/{min}/{max}{self.sid}",
      self.Splinter
    )
```

#### Push Volume

```python
def push_volume(parent_vid, writer_vid):
  # isolate metadata operations on this volume
  with metadata_lock(parent_vid):
    pending_commit = prepare_commit(parent_vid, writer_vid)
    remote_commit(parent_vid, writer_vid, pending_commit)

def prepare_commit(parent_vid, writer_vid):
    # ensure the writer is still the writer
    assert_eq(read(f"volumes/{parent_vid}/writer"), writer_vid)

    # check for pending commit
    pending_commit = read(f"volumes/{writer_vid}/pending_commit")
    if pending_commit:
      return pending_commit

    # otherwise, we need to build a new pending commit
    parent_snapshot = first(f"log/{parent_vid}")
    parent_checkpoint = first(f"volumes/{parent_vid}/checkpoint")
    writer_snapshot = first(f"log/{writer_vid}")

    last_sync = read(f"volumes/{writer_vid}/last_sync")
    assert(writer_snapshot.lsn != last_sync.fork.lsn, "nothing to commit")

    bottom_lsn = last_sync.fork.lsn
    top_lsn = writer_snapshot.lsn

    # build and push segments from commits
    (segment_refs, page_count) = build_and_push_segments(writer_vid, bottom_lsn, top_lsn)

```

- if pending_commit skip to committing to remote storage
- collect segments
  - `start_lsn = last_sync.fork.lsn`
  - `snapshot = first log/{writer_vid}`
  - `iter segments/{writer_vid}/{..=start_lsn}`
    - build segments
- push segments
- write pending_commit
- commit to remote storage
- if success:
  - fjall batch
    - write snapshot + segments to parent log
      - optimization: segment refs here can be refs to the writer segments! this allows page reuse, however it means that the segment index will be out of sync
    - clear pending commit
    - update last_sync
- if transient failure:
  - log error, schedule retry
- if reject:
  - clear pending commit, trigger pull on parent

#### Pull volume
- pull commits into remote vid
- also write commit into writer vid if exists
  - if so, add a SyncOp mapping the remote lsn to the writer lsn

#### Reset volume
- open new writer vid
- update writer pointer on upstream vid
- eventually GC old vid once read snapshots drop

### Splinter improvements

This RFC depends on the following new [Splinter] features:

- `offset_of(key: u32) -> Option<usize>`
  - returns the zero-based offset of a given key in the Splinter.
  - returns None if the key is not contained by the Splinter.
- `bounds() -> Option<(u32, u32)>`
  - if the Splinter is non-empty, returns the minimum and maximum key stored in the Splinter.
- `iter_range(offsets) -> impl Iterator<Item=u32>`
  - returns an iterator of the keys selected by the offset range.
  - we could instead just override `Iterator::nth` on the existing Splinter iterator. This composes with the rest of the Iterator ecosystem.

All new methods should be implemented on both Splinter and SplinterRef.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other projects and what experience has their community had?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or inspired.

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.  The section merely provides additional information.
