title: Consistency Model
description: An overview of Graft's consistency and isolation model

_(This model only applies when using the official Graft Client with Graft Server. Third-party client implementations may violate this model.)_

## Global Consistency

Graft provides **[Serializable Snapshot Isolation](https://distributed-computing-musings.com/2022/02/transactions-serializable-snapshot-isolation/)** globally.

All read operations are executed on an isolated snapshot of a Volume.

A write transaction must be based on the latest snapshot to commit. Assuming a compliant Graft client, this enforces [Strict Serializable](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strong-serializable).

## Local Consistency

By default, Graft clients commit locally and then asynchronously attempt to commit remotely. Because Graft enforces **Strict Serializability** globally, when two clients concurrently commit based on the same snapshot, one commit will succeed and the other will fail.

Upon rejection, the client must choose one of:

1. **Fork the volume permanently**: This results in a new volume and retains **Strict Serializability**.
2. **Reset and replay**: Reset to the latest snapshot from the server, replay local transactions, and attempt again.
   - The global consistency remains **Strict Serializable**.
   - Locally, the client experiences **Optimistic Snapshot Isolation**, meaning:
     - Reads always observe internally consistent snapshots.
     - However, these snapshots may later be discarded if the commit is rejected.
3. **Merge**: Attempt to merge the remote snapshot with local commits. _(Not yet implemented by Graft; this degrades global consistency to [snapshot isolation](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/snapshot-isolation))_

**Optimistic Snapshot Isolation:**

Under optimistic snapshot isolation, a client may observe a snapshot which never exists in the global timeline. Here is an example of this in action:

<Steps>

1. Initial state on all clients

    ```sql
    create table accounts (id, bal, check(bal >= 0));
    insert into accounts values (1, 10);
    ```

2. client A commits locally:

    ```sql
    sqlite> update accounts set bal = bal - 10 where id = 1

    -- accounts = [ { id: 1, bal: 0 } ]
    ```

3. client B commits concurrently:

   ```sql
   sqlite> update accounts set bal = bal - 5 where id = 1

   -- accounts = [ { id: 1, bal: 5 } ]
   ```

4. client B reads from the database before syncing with the server:

   ```sql
   sqlite> select * from accounts
   +----+-----+
   | id | bal |
   +----+-----+
   | 1  | 5   |
   +----+-----+
   ```

5. client A successfully pushes their commit to the server.

6. client Bâ€™s commit is rejected by the server and resets to the latest server snapshot.

7. client B attempts to replay their last transaction:
   ```sql
   sqlite> update accounts set bal = bal - 5 where id = 1
   (275) abort at 13 in [update accounts set bal = bal - 5 where id = 1;]: CHECK constraint failed: bal >= 0
   Runtime error: CHECK constraint failed: bal >= 0 (19)
   ```

</Steps>

At this stage, client B should ideally replay or invalidate the query in step (4). If external state changes were based on that read, the client must perform reconciliation to ensure correctness.
