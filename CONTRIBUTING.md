# Contributing to Graft

Welcome to the orbitinghail Graft repo! We are so excited you are here. Thank you for your interest in contributing your time and expertise to the project. The following document details contribution guidelines.

Whether you're addressing an open issue (or filing a new one), fixing a typo in our documentation, adding to core capabilities of the project, or introducing a new use case, all kinds of contributions are welcome.

## Gaining consensus

Before working on Graft, it's important to gain consensus on what you want to change or build. This will streamline the PR review process and make sure that your work is aligned with the projects goals. This can be done in a number of ways:

- [File an issue]: best for bug reports and concrete feature requests
- [Start a discussion]: best for ideas and more abstract topics
- [Join the Discord]: best for real-time collaboration

[File an issue]: https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft/issues/new
[Start a discussion]: https://github.com/orbitinghail/graft/discussions/new/choose
[Join the Discord]: https://discord.gg/etFk2N9nzC

Once you're ready to start building, it's time to get Graft running on your computer!

## Coding style

Graft is low-level systems software. Prioritize safety, performance, and clarity above all. Follow these principles which are based on [TigerStyle]:

[TigerStyle]: https://tigerstyle.dev/

**Safety:**

- Control Flow: Use simple, explicit control structures. Avoid recursion. Keep functions under 70 lines. Centralize branching logic in parent functions.
- Memory & Types: Use fixed-size types (e.g. u32, i64). Avoid runtime allocation—allocate memory at startup or make use of the stack.
- Error Handling: Use assertions for invariants and argument checks. Treat warnings as errors.

**Performance:**

- Early Design: Apply napkin math to estimate bottlenecks. Design for performance from the start.
- Batching: Batch I/O or expensive operations. Prioritize optimizing network > disk > memory > CPU.
- Predictability: Write predictable, branch-friendly code. Don't rely on compiler optimizations.

**Clarity:**

- Naming: Use clear variable names. Avoid abbreviations and single-letter variable names. Use specific types like ByteUnit and Duration rather than bare types for variables that have logical units.
- Structure: Keep functions simple. Group related code. Declare variables near usage.
- Consistency: Avoid aliases/dupes. Pass large values by reference. Maintain consistent indentation, comment style, and toolchain. Write idiomatic Rust code.
- Off-by-One Safety: Treat indexes, counts, sizes as distinct. Be explicit in rounding and division.

## Running Graft locally

To build and run Graft, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

| Name          | Where to Get It        |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| rust + cargo  | [rustup]               |
| just          | [just]                 |
| cargo nextest | [nextest]              |
| clang + llvm  | System package manager |
| mold          | System package manager |

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/
[just]: https://github.com/casey/just
[nextest]: https://nexte.st/docs/installation/pre-built-binaries/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graft uses [`bindgen`] to generate Rust bindings for SQLite, which requires a working installation of Clang and LLVM. If you're not sure whether your system is set up correctly, follow the [official bindgen setup guide] for instructions tailored to your platform. This step is essential—missing or misconfigured Clang will cause build failures when compiling the `graft-sqlite` and `graft-sqlite-extension` crates.

[`bindgen`]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/
[official bindgen setup guide]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html

The easiest way to ensure everything works is to run the tests. This can be done via `just test` for a single command that runs everything, or you can run individual test suites like so:

```bash
# Test the whole workspace or an individual crate
# cargo nextest run [-p <crate>] [-- <filter for a specific test name>]
cargo nextest run
cargo nextest run -p splinter
cargo nextest run client_sync_sanity

# Run SQLite tests
just run sqlite test
```

Next, if you'd like to run Graft locally run the following commands in different terminals:

```bash
# first, start a local Graft Metastore
cargo run --bin metastore

# next, in another terminal, run a local Graft pagestore
cargo run --bin pagestore

# finally, you can open up a SQLite shell connected to 127.0.0.1
just run sqlite shell
```

## Pull Request (PR) process

To ensure your contribution is reviewed, all pull requests must be made against the `main` branch.

PRs must include a brief summary of what the change is, any issues associated with the change, and any fixes the change addresses. Please include the relevant link(s) for any fixed issues.

Pull requests do not have to pass all automated checks before being opened, but all checks must pass before merging. This can be useful if you need help figuring out why a required check is failing.

Our automated PR checks verify that:

- All unit tests pass, which can be done locally by running `just test`
- The code has been formatted correctly, according to `cargo fmt`.
- There are no linting errors, according to `cargo clippy`.
