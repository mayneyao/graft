Build a new Graft client library (called `graft-kernel`) which directly interfaces with object storage, eliminating the need for the MetaStore and PageStore, and setting Graft up as a viable replacement to systems like Litestream. Graft should focus on providing best-in-class PITR, branching, and sparse replication for page-based workloads.

## Motivation

An overview of why we should consider making this major change to Graft's architecture.

### Existing state of Graft

Currently Graft requires a MetaStore and PageStore to support replication to and from object storage. This architecture has the following advantages and disadvantages:

**Advantages**
- The MetaStore can efficiently rollup commits to fast forward clients, increasing performance and enabling instant read replicas
- The PageStore acts as a smart cache, allowing clients to pull only the pages they need at the edge.
- The PageStore is able to collocate writes to multiple Volumes in the same Segment, reducing cost for high write rates.

**Disadvantages**
- There is little isolation between data in different Volumes. Graft will need to roll out a comprehensive encryption + authorization layer to work for production workloads. This is a huge cost in terms of testing and engineering.
- Users must run two services to take full advantage of Graft, this makes Graft much harder to use.

### [Datasette]

In a discussion with [Simon Willison] and [Alex Garcia], we talked about some of their dream features for SQLite + Graft:

**Rollback database to earlier version**
The ability to cheaply rollback a database would make risky features like giving an LLM read/write access to your database much safer. Additionally, the ability to branch a database at a particular version may enable risk-free experimentation and testing.

**Read-only replication**
Cheap and fast read-only replication to horizontally scale a heavy query workload over multiple machines, or simply to expose data to less-trusted users.

**Composability with IAM permissions**
Currently, Datasette uses IAM keys limited to a single S3 prefix to restrict Litestream's access to a single tenant's data. This ensures that a bug in Litestream can affect at most a single tenant.

This feature implies that data does not cross "tenant" boundaries (or in this case, the configured S3 prefix).

### Object storage scalability

In a discussion with a potential user, they expressed reservations due to the layer of indirection between the Graft client and object storage. Their main argument is that S3 is already proven to handle extremely high scale. They would be more comfortable using Graft if clients connected directly to object storage to pull changes. In some cases, this may also reduce costs due to free bandwidth between compute and S3.

### New user experience

Graft should work out of the box without needing additional services to run. By supporting direct access to object storage, it will be easier to get started and embed Graft in an application.

## Guide-level Explanation

A high level explanation of how this feature works, and would change the behavior of existing Graft clients such as `graft-sqlite` and `graft-fuse`.

### `graft-kernel`

`graft-kernel` implements the Graft Kernel which supersedes the functionality of the `graft-client` and `graft-server` crates. The Kernel provides access to a remote Volume Catalog, local storage, and client functionality to downstream crates like `graft-sqlite` and `graft-fuse`.

**Volume Catalog**
This subsystem provides push and pull functionality to Volume commit logs. It's designed to support multiple backends including direct access to object storage and the graft-proxy.

**Local storage**
This subsystem provides durable storage for the Volume Catalog, Pages, and Volume State. It's extremely similar to the existing `graft-client` storage subsystem.

**Client functionality**
Clients such as `graft-sqlite` and `graft-fuse` will use the `graft-kernel` to operate on Volumes. The Kernel is designed to be embedded in the application, performing I/O in a small set of background threads. The Kernel will be implemented as an async core wrapped with an async and sync API.

### `graft-proxy`

The Graft Proxy is a stateless edge service and caching layer which makes it easier for Graft to replicate to & from devices. Initially it will simply act as a pass-through proxy to object storage with its own authentication and authorization layer.

Graft Proxy exposes a simple API to consumers, enabling two key performance features:
1. Graft Proxy acts like a read through cache, ideally using ephemeral NVME drives
2. Replica fast-forwarding: collapse a pull graft request and only return the latest segments.

Eventually Graft Proxy will enhance Graft with these features:
- volume subscriptions -> eliminate the need to poll for changes
- granular authorization
- direct byte range puts and gets against Volumes

## Reference-level Explanation

Detailed technical breakdown. Cover APIs, algorithms, data structures, formats, edge cases, and performance implications.

### Glossary

- **`vid`**: A 16 byte Volume ID using [`GID`] encoding.
- **`sid`**: A 16 byte Segment ID using [`GID`] encoding.
- **`lsn`**: A 8 byte log sequence number, representing a fixed point in a log. Valid range: `[1, 2^64)`.
- **`pageidx`**: A 4 byte page index, representing the index of a page within a Volume. Valid range: `[1, 2^32)`.
- **`Splinter`**: A compressed bitset, used to keep track of which `pageidxs` appear in a Segment.
- **`Segment`**: A set of pages, sorted by `pageidx`.

### Remote storage

#### Object storage keyspace

Graft will store all of a Volume's data in Object Storage using the following keyspace layout:

```
{prefix} /
  volumes /
    {vid} /
      control: Control
      forks /
        {fork-vid}: Fork
      checkpoints /
        {lsn}: Checkpoint
      log /
        {lsn}: Commit
      segments /
        {sid}: Segment
```

This flexible layout allows users to isolate tenants from one another by simply providing a unique `{prefix}`. Or, ignoring `{prefix}` all-together.

#### Object storage schemas

All of the files aside from Segments are encoded using Protobuf. Segments are simply a set of pages stored back-to-back, ordered by `pageidx` ascending.

```proto
syntax = "proto3"

package graft.remote.v1;

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

// Storage must provide the following additional system metadata:
//  - Last-Modified: The object creation or updated date
//  - Checksum: The object's checksum
// Allowing these fields to be omitted.

// A Volume has a top level control file stored at
// `{prefix}/volumes/{vid}/control`
// Control files are immutable.
message Control {
  // The Volume ID stored as a 16 byte GID.
  bytes vid = 1;

  // The parent reference if this Volume is a fork.
  VolumeRef parent = 2;

  // The creation timestamp of this Volume.
  google.protobuf.Timestamp created_at = 3;
}

// When a Volume is forked, a ref is first written to the source volume:
// `{prefix}/volumes/{source-vid}/forks/{fork-vid}`
// Forks are immutable.
message Fork {
  // The VID of the fork.
  bytes vid = 1;
}

// A reference to a Volume at a particular LSN.
message VolumeRef {
  // The Volume ID stored as a 16 byte GID.
  bytes vid = 1;

  // The referenced LSN.
  uint64 lsn = 2;
}

// Checkpoints are stored at `{prefix}/volumes/{vid}/checkpoints/{lsn}`.
// {lsn} is a 64 bit number stored as a fixed-width 16 character hex string.
// Checkpoints are immutable.
message Checkpoint {
  // The total number of pages in the Volume at this Checkpoint.
  uint32 page_count = 1;

  // The list of SegmentRefs representing this Checkpoint.
  repeated SegmentRef segments = 2;
}

// Commits are stored at `{prefix}/volumes/{vid}/log/{lsn}`.
// {lsn} is a 64 bit number stored as a fixed-width 16 character hex string.
// Commits are immutable.
// There are some valid cases for a commit to not include any SegmentRefs:
//  - The volume is a fork and has rebased itself on the parent. An empty commit is used to ensure that LSNs retain monotonicity.
//  - The commit marks a new checkpoint.
//  - The Volume has been truncated or extended causing the `page_count` to change, but no new pages to be written.
message Commit {
  // The total number of pages in the Volume at this Commit.
  uint32 page_count = 1;

  // The latest checkpoint LSN.
  // To recover the Volume's latest state, replay this checkpoint and the log starting from the checkpoint LSNs successor.
  // Earlier LSNs and checkpoints may be garbage collected at any point.
  uint64 checkpoint_lsn = 2;

  // The list of SegmentRefs representing this Commit.
  repeated SegmentRef segments = 3;
}

message SegmentRef {
  // The 16 byte Segment ID.
  bytes sid = 1;

  // The set of pageidxs stored in this Segment.
  // Serialized using Splinter encoding.
  bytes splinter = 2;
}
```

### Local storage

This section documents how clients store data.

#### Local keyspace
Local storage uses [Fjall], a partitioned k/v store. In the following keyspace, the top level keys are independent partitions. The remainder of the keys and the values are encoded using types in the following section.

```
volumes /
  {vid} /
    writer -> Fork
    parent -> VolumeRef
    pending_commit -> PendingCommit

log / {vid} / {lsn} -> LocalCommit
log / {vid} / {lsn} / {sid} -> Splinter

pages / {sid} / {pageidx} -> Page
```

#### Local schemas

Keys which are stored in the local keyspace are encoded using `zerocopy` types. `lsn` values are stored using `CBE64`, which ensures they naturally sort in descending order. This allows us to use a forward iterator to quickly find the most recent LSN, which is much more efficient in most k/v stores (including [Fjall]).

Values stored locally are encoded using protobuf, using a combination of the remote storage schema and the following additional message types.

```proto
syntax = "proto3"

package graft.local.v1;

// An inclusive range of LSNs.
message LsnRange {
  uint64 inclusive_start = 1;
  uint64 inclusive_end = 2;
}

// PendingCommit is stored at `volumes/{vid}/pending_commit` on the
// writing Volume ID. It is part of our two-phase commit protocol used to sync
// local changes to a remote volume.
message PendingCommit {
  // The LSN range we are attempting to sync from the writing fork to the
  // remote volume.
  LsnRange sync_range = 1;

  // The latest remote LSN. If this commit is successful it will land at `remote_lsn + 1`.
  uint64 remote_lsn = 2;

  // The full remote commit we are attempting to sync.
  graft.remote.v1.Commit commit = 3;
}

// stored at log/{vid}/{lsn}
message LocalCommit {
  uint32 page_count = 1;
}
```

### Algorithms

**TODO: plan for sync protocol**
- push
  - build and push segments
  - write pending commit
  - commit
  - if success:
    - fjall batch
      - write commit to parent vid
      - drop synced local commits up to the last sync lsn from writer vid
      - remove segments from last sync lsn in writer vid
      - migrate pages from old to new segments
      - update writer vid parent ref
  - if failure:
    - drop pending commit
    - record failure (WHERE??)
- pull
  - pull commits into remote vid
  - rebase writer vid if possible
    - if diverged record failure (WHERE??)


#### Pull changes

```
Pull changes starting at LSN 8:
  GET $prefix/volumes/$VID/log/9 -> 200 Commit(9, Segment(1))
    PUT Commit(9) -> commits/$VID/9
      PUT Segment(1) -> segments/$VID/9/$SID
        for pageidx in Segment:
          PUT Pending -> pages/$VID/$pageidx/9

  GET $prefix/volumes/$VID/log/10 -> 200 Commit(10, Checkpoint(1-4, Segment(2))
    PUT Commit(10) -> commits/$VID/10
      DEL commits/$VID/{1-4}/*
      PUT Commit(10) -> commits/$VID/4
        PUT Segment(2) -> segments/$VID/4/$SID
          for pageidx in Segment:
            PUT_IF_NOT_EXISTS Pending -> pages/$VID/$pageidx/4

  GET $prefix/volumes/$VID/log/11 -> 404
```

#### Read transaction

```
Open snapshot at LSN 10

Read page 5 at LSN=10
  storage.read(vid=$VID, lsn=10, page=5)
    if found:
      oracle.observe_cache_hit(5)
      return page

  issue a blocking read:
    self.read_head.read(lsn=10, page=5, oracle.predict_next(5))

  return storage.read(lsn=10, page=5)

Segment Fetcher:
  A background thread that is responsible for fetching pages from remote storage as the read heads issue reads.

  read_head updates:
    vid = read_head.vid

    optimistically check to see if the read is already satisfied
      if storage.read(vid, lsn=read_head.lsn, page=read_head.page)
        read_head.complete()

    start loading segments:
      for (key, segment) in segments/$vid/10..segments/$vid/1:
        let cut = pages.cut(segment.graft)
        if !cut.is_empty():
          notifier = cut.contains(read_head.page).and_then(read_head)
          loader.add(key.vid, key.lsn, segment, cut, priority, notifier)
```

#### Write transaction

IDEA: instead of overloading local and remote LSNs which makes sync more tricky we can instead append a 4 byte local LSN to the remote LSN. This allows us to write all local commits to the same *next* remote LSN at sequential local LSNs.

```
Open snapshot at read LSN 10
Take write lock on Volume and allocate write LSN 11.1

txn state:
  page_count = snapshot.page_count

read page 5:
  execute read algorithm at LSN 11.1

write page 5:
  storage.put(vid, lsn=11.1, pageidx=5, data) -> pages/$vid/$pageidx/$lsn
  storage.stage(vid, lsn=11.1, pageidx=5) -> staged/$vid/$lsn/$pageidx
  page_count = max(page_count, 5)

rollback/drop:
  storage.bulk_delete(vid, lsn=11)

commit:
  graft = Splinter{}
  for pageidx in ITER staged/$vid/$lsn/$pageidx:
    DEL staged/$vid/$lsn/$pageidx
    graft.add(pageidx)
  storage.stage_commit(vid, lsn=11, page_count, graft)
    -> staged/$vid/$lsn -> StagedCommit { page_count, graft }
```

### Segment encoding

Segments store a set of pages for a single Volume at a single LSN. Each segment has a maximum size of 16 MB.

Open decisions:
- segment compression? pro=smaller, con=range requests
- segment index? depends on how the volume catalog will work + what the read algorithm looks like. once we figure those things out, then we can return to segments
- footer/header? footer allows pages in segments to be page aligned

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other projects and what experience has their community had?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or inspired.

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.  The section merely provides additional information.
